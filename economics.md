# How is (should be) wealth distributed?

I have been wondering for some time about what would be a "fair" society, in which wealth is fairly distributed.
Naively one could assume that in an ideal world everyone should own the same wealth, i.e. a delta distribution.
A more realistic distribution could be some kind of Gaussian.

However, wealth is not static, and it changes with time as people trade.
In this notebook by Peter Norvig there is a fun simulation of economics:

There are quite a few interesting conclusions one can draw from first principles:
- the Gaussian will sooner or later become a Beta
- economic regulations (taxes etc.) can influence the evolution of the distribution
- local and global transactions impact the distribution in about the same way
